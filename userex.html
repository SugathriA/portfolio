					<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
					<p>Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS), is a product that automates data center operations. In the existing UI for
						Cisco VTS, user has to traverse the navigation to get the overlay object that needs to be managed and deal with
						complex UI forms. There is a huge scope to improve the user experience by using natural langugage assistant in
						this product.</p>
					<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
					<P>In the current VTS UI, Service Provider administrator (SP Admin such as Verizon, Telstra) is the target user.
					</p>
					<p>Any overlay object configuration is complicated to solve. As an example I am using the task of attaching port
						to network. Attaching port to a network enables the network in a data center. <br />
						To achieve this user has to:
						<ul>
							<li>Select the tenant.</li>
							<li> Select the desired network. </li>
							<li>Select the device. </li>
							<li>Select the port on device. </li>&nbsp;
						</ul>
						This involves many traversal, clicks, selections to find the right port.Below are some screenshots from UI
						depicting the flow. </p>
					</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/ux/port_attach_storyboard.png" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
					<p>The proposed solution was designing a mobile application that is voice enabled. This natural language voice
						assistant app lets the user accomplish this task without having to navigate and find the right network and port.
						All user needs to do is take the assistance of app prompts and respond.</p>
					<p>I proposed this idea and came up with this video as a proof of concept.</p>
					<video controls class="image featured">
						<source src="images/voice_app.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					</video>

					<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
					<p>This solution helps in overcoming the complexity of managing data center objects with an interactive natural
						language voice assistant where users can initiate a task. The applicaion then prompts for information to supply
						or initiate the next command. It displays context of the command and status of the object. That way user can view
						the interactions of each step in a visual way and intuitively complete it. This eliminates complex traversal in
						the navigation to get to the right object to configure, eliminates the need to go to CLI or use complex UI forms,
						gain an ability to see information in-context, and know if the task can be successful much earlier.Cisco patent
						was filed for this design.</p>

					<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
					<p>Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS), is a product that automates data center operations. There was a feature
						request that allows users to spawn Virtual Machines(VMs). This is a very data intense, complex problem to solve
						and the solution has to scalable irrespective of the number of devices in a data center. </p>
					<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
					<P>In the current VTS UI, Service Provider administrator (SP Admin such as Verizon, Telstra) is the target user.
					</p>
					<p>A data center typically consists of devices (switches). Each switch can have 1-13 modules. Each module has 48
						ports also called as interfaces. The challange in this problem is the scale. There could be up to 156 devices in
						a data center. User can select any number of devices and any number of ports and define any number of ranges.
						Also in a scenario where user needs to edit, information related to devices, interfaces and ranges should be
						displayed in order to make any changes. </p>
					<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
					<p>The proposed solution was to build a work flow in the UI that addresses the problem and visual represention of
						the interfaces in both Define and Edit scenarios. User has to first define a group. Select one or more devices.
						Select interfaces per device. Assign some ranges. Now VMs can be spawned in this range in the data center.</p>
					<p> My role in providing this solution is white boarding to gather these requirements and understand the
						scenarios. Story boarding the flow. Providing several design options and discussing with product team,
						architects, developers and iterating designs based on their feedback. Providing high fidelity Mock ups and
						redline specs for the final design.</p>

					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/desprovts_image4.png" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
					<p>This work flow solution helps in dealing with the scale as it is broken in to several steps. At each step user
						is only dealing with one step of data. Also the visual representation of selected device ports, helps user
						identify them quickly. Cisco patent was filed for this design.</p>

					<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
					<p>Cisco All In One (AIO) is a product that is used to manage Cisco Virtually Managed Services (VMS) deployment
						environments. The current UI had to be redesigned enhancing the user experience. </p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/desproaio_image1.png" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
					<P>In the current AIO UI, VMS deployments administrator is the target user. </p>
					<P>There are many usability issues, pain points in the current UI. Many tasks are not in context. No consistency
						in language. No help on the complex UI forms. Lot of data on one page with no search functionality. All these
						issues have to be addressed and an efficient and enjoyable experience should be built. </p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/desproaio_image2.png" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
					<p>The proposed solution was to show an overview of AIOs that helps user to make decisions on what AIO should be
						used. Moving all actions related to AIO at one place. Cleaning up the forms and adding ghost text. Combining the
						related tasks to simplify and avoid clutter in design.</p>
					<p>My role in providing this solution is identifying pain points using heuristic evaulation. Conducting task
						analysis to realize efficiency of each task. Coming up with several design options and conducting usability
						studies with the users. Iterating to provide final design.</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/desproaio_image3.png" alt="" /></a>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/desproaio_image4.png" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
					<p>The solution is not only easy to use but has greatly benefited the admin users in quickly identifying the
						isssues with AIOs. </p>

					<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
					<p>Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS), is a product that automates data center operations. Many new features
						are added to the product at a fast pace. Everytime new features are added user being able to find them with
						ease is critical in the product. The task of validating the current navigation with users was taken up. </p>
					<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
					<P>In the current VTS UI, Service Provider administrator (SP Admin such as Verizon, Telstra) is the target user.
					</p>
					<P>New and returning users should be able to navigate through product with ease. Making navigation disoverable,
						accessible and contextual is challenging. </P>
					<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
					<p>The proposed solution was to put forward a navigation that is consistent, strives for flat navigation and
						imitates the structure of data center in real world.</p>
					<p>My role in this exercise was conducting in-person interviews, using online Optimal cardsort technique and
						anyzing the results provided by all users. Based on the results proposing an efficient navigation system.</p>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/IA.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
					<p>This navigation enhaces the usability of the product. This makes the product very simple, usable and lets
						user accomplish tasks efficiently. Lot of back and forth is avoided in the solution and all the UI problems
						buried underneath because of platform constraints are addressed. </p>

						<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
						<p>As a designer the most important thing is to be empathetic towards users, know the users and think fron
							their point of view. Here are a few examples from different projects where I have worked on identifying
							Personas, their goals, roles and behaviors. </p>
						<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
						<P>Each of the projects below have different target audience. They are broadly classified in the persona
							types.</p>
						<P>The challenging part is to identify how the users interact with the product, the usage patterns in
							different scenarios, user behaviors, roles and goals. </P>
						<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
						<p>Below are the personas I created for three different Projects.</p>
						<p>My role in this exercise was conducting in-person interviews, surveys, data anlytics etc to know the users.
							working with user researchers to find patterns of usage by users. Define the personas. Document the Personas.
