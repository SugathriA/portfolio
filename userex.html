						<p><strong>Voice user interface for data center operations</strong></p>
					</div>

					<div class="titles">
						<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
						<p>Cisco Virtual Topology System VTS, is a product that automates data center operations. In the existing UI ,
							user has to traverse the navigation to configure the data center overlay objects and deal with
							complex UI forms. There is a huge scope to improve the user experience by using natural langugage assistant in
							this product.</p>
						<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
						<P>In the current VTS UI, Service Provider Administrator (SP Admin such as Verizon, Telstra) is the target user.</p>
						<p>The problem that is being solved is to make any overlay object configuration simple. Using the current VTS UI,
							it
							is quite a long process. To better explain this I am using, an example of the task of attaching port to network.
							Attaching port to a network enables the network (overlay object) in a data center.</p>
						<p>To achieve this user has to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Select the tenant.</li>
							<li>Select the desired network. </li>
							<li>Edit the network.
							<li>Initiate port attach.
							<li>Select the device. </li>
							<li>Select the port on device. </li>
							<li>Select the baremetal to which it has to be attached to.</li>
							<li>Select the port on baremetal.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>This involves traversal, clicks, selections to find the right port. Below are some screenshots from UI
							depicting the flow. While doing these steps if any of the devices are down, user cannot be notified right away.
						</p>
						<h4>Network port attach flow</h4>

							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/ux/port_attach_storyboard.png" alt="" /></div>
						</article>
						<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
						<p>The proposed solution was designing a mobile application that is voice enabled. This natural language voice
							assistant app lets the user accomplish this task without having to navigate and find the right network and port.
							All user needs to do is take the assistance of app prompts and respond.</p>
						<!--<div class="banner-highlight ux">-->
						<p>I am the lead designer for VTS. It was originally my idea to innovate the current product with natural voice
							assistance. I supported my idea
							with this video as a proof of concept.</p>
						<!--</div>-->
						<video controls class="image featured">
							<source src="images/voice_app.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						</video>

						<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
						<p>This solution helps in overcoming the complexity of managing data center objects.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Interactive natural language voice assistant. </li>
							<li>Prompts for information to supply or initiate the next command.</li>
							<li>Displays context of the command and status of the object. </li>
							<li>User can view the interactions of each step in a visual way and intuitively complete it. </li>
							<li>Eliminates complex traversal in the navigation to get to the right object to configure. </li>
							<li>Eliminates the need to go to CLI or use complex UI forms.</li>
							<li>Provides ability to see information in-context, and know if the task can be successful much earlier.
							<li>Cisco patent was filed for this design.</li>

						<p><strong>User interface matching real world for data center operations</strong></p>
					</div>
					<div class="titles">
						<h4>What is the significance of this Project?</h4>
						<p>Cisco Virtual Topology System (VTS), is a product that automates data center operations. There was a feature
							request that allows users to group multiple interfaces across data center devices and assign ranges.
							This allows the user in spawing Virual Machines later in those ranges. This is a very data intense, complex
							problem to solve
							and the solution has to scalable irrespective of the number of devices in a data center. </p>
						<h4>Who are the target audience and what is the design problem being solved?</h4>
						<P>In the current VTS UI, Service Provider Administrator (SP Admin such as Verizon, Telstra) is the target user.
						</p>
						<p>The problem that is being solved is to create interface group in a simple way.
							Below are some numbers that explain the challenge of this problem which is scale</p>
						<ul>
							<li>A data center can have 156 devices (switches). </li>
							<li>Each switch can have 1-13 modules.</li>
							<li>Each module has 48 ports also called as interfaces.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>User can select any number of devices and any number of ports and define any number of ranges.
							Also in a scenario where user needs to edit, information related to devices, interfaces and ranges should be
							displayed in order to make any changes. </p>
						<h4>What is the proposed solution and what is my role in it?</h4>
						<p>The proposed solution was to build a work flow in the UI. Workflow addressing the problem and visual
							represention of
							the interfaces in both define and edit scenarios. The steps user needs to take in the workflow are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Define a group.</li>
							<li>Select one or more devices.</li>
							<li>Select one or more interfaces per device.</li>
							<li>Assign some ranges. </li>
						</ul>
						<p>My role in providing this solution is:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>White boarding to gather these requirements.</li>
							<li>Understand the scenarios. </li>
							<li>Story boarding the flow. </li>
							<li>Providing several design options.</li>
							<li>Discussing options with product team, architects and developers. </li>
							<li>Iterating designs based on their feedback.</li>
							<li>Providing high fidelity Mock ups.</li>
							<li>Redline specs for the final design.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>What is cool about this solution?</h4>
						<p>This work flow solution helps in dealing with the scale as it is broken in to several steps. At each step user
							is only dealing with one step of data. Also the visual representation of selected device ports, helps user
							identify them quickly. It also reduces the clutter on UI. Cisco patent was filed for this design.</p>

						<h4>What is the significance of defining Personas?</h4>
						<p>As a designer the most important thing is to be empathetic towards users, know the users and think fron
							their point of view. Here is an example where I have worked on identifying Personas, their goals, roles
							and behaviors.</p>

						<h4>what is my role in defining personas?</h4>
						<p>My role was to work along with user researchers to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Identify how the users interact with the products.</li>
							<li>Find usage patterns in different scenarios.</li>
							<li>Conducting in-person interviews to study user behaviors, roles and goals.</li>
							<li>Conduct survey and analyze results, data anlytics.</li>

						<h4>How Customer Journey Map helped in enhancing the experience of the product Cisco VTS?</h4>
						<p>Customer Journey Map is to get feedback from users, on the end-to-end experience of the product. The areas
							that are covered in this exercuse are I am aware, I shop, I buy, I reecive, I install, I use, I renew.
							The reason to pick Customer Journey Map was to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Build empathy towards users</li>
							<li>Provide a common 'Big Picture'</li>
							<li>Break silos</li>
							<li>Bring focus</li>
							<li>Identify opportunities</li>
						</ul>
						<article class="box">
							<div class="image featured"><img src="images/ux/VTS_JourneyMap.png" alt="" /></div>
						</article>
						<p>Working along with user reseachers, we talked to Advanced Services, Engineering, Techincal Marketing and TAC.
							These users represent the end customers but they are not the end customers themselves.
							In each of the above mentioned areas, the users provided feedback, findings were categorized in to
							what went well and what could be done better. Based on the feedback recommendations were made to improve the
							produuct.
